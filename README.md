An OOPs refresher project that to practice the fundamentals of object-oriented programming. This project demonstrates how abstraction (hiding of details of implementation in this context) and encapsulation (grouping attributes and into a class) using multiple objects (Game, Board, Unit) makes coding a logic based board game organized and simple.
